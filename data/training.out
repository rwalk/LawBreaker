I am a king that find thee; and I know

'Tis not the balm, the sceptre, and the ball,

The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,

The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,

The farced tide running fore the king,

The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp

That beats upon the high shore of this world-

No, not all these, thrice gorgeous ceremony,

Not all these, laid in bed majestical,

Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave

Who, with a body fill'd and vacant mind,

Gets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread;

Never sees horrid night, the child of hell;

But, like a lackey, from the rise to set

Sweats in the eye of Pheebus, and all night

Sleeps in Elysium; next day, after dawn,

Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse;

And follows so the ever-running year

With profitable labour, to his grave.

And but for ceremony, such a wretch,

Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,

Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.

The slave, a member of the country's peace,

Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wots

What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace

Whose hours the peasant best advantages.

Enter ERPINGHAM

ERPINGHAM. My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence,

Seek through your camp to find you.

BAPTISTA. How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?

GREMIO. Believe me, sir, they butt together well.

BIANCA. Head and butt! An hasty-witted body

Would say your head and butt were head and horn.

VINCENTIO. Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?

BIANCA. Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.

PETRUCHIO. Nay, that you shall not; since you have begun,

Have at you for a bitter jest or two.

BIANCA. Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,

And then pursue me as you draw your bow.

You are welcome all.

Exeunt BIANCA, KATHERINA, and WIDOW

PETRUCHIO. She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio,

This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;

Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.

TRANIO. O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,

Which runs himself, and catches for his master.

PETRUCHIO. A good swift simile, but something currish.

TRANIO. 'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself;

'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.

BAPTISTA. O, O, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.

LUCENTIO. I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.

HORTENSIO. Confess, confess; hath he not hit you here?

PETRUCHIO. 'A has a little gall'd me, I confess;

And, as the jest did glance away from me,

'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.

BAPTISTA. Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,

I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.

PETRUCHIO. Well, I say no; and therefore, for assurance,

Let's each one send unto his wife,

And he whose wife is most obedient,

Why then, good night indeed.

CANIDIUS. Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.

SCARUS. 'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend

What further comes.

CANIDIUS. To Caesar will I render

My legions and my horse; six kings already

Show me the way of yielding.

ENOBARBUS. I'll yet follow

The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason

Sits in the wind against me.                          Exeunt

ACT_3|SC_11

SCENE XI.

Alexandria. CLEOPATRA'S palace

Enter ANTONY With attendants

ANTONY. Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;

It is asham'd to bear me. Friends, come hither.

I am so lated in the world that I

Have lost my way for ever. I have a ship

Laden with gold; take that; divide it. Fly,

And make your peace with Caesar.

ALL. Fly? Not we!

ANTONY. I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards

To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;

I have myself resolv'd upon a course

Which has no need of you; be gone.

My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,

I follow'd that I blush to look upon.

My very hairs do mutiny; for the white

Then hate me when thou wilt, if ever, now,

Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross,

join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,

And do not drop in for an after-loss:

Ah do not, when my heart hath 'scaped this sorrow,

Come in the rearward of a conquered woe,

Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,

To linger out a purposed overthrow.

If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,

When other petty griefs have done their spite,

But in the onset come, so shall I taste

At first the very worst of fortune's might.

And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,

Compared with loss of thee, will not seem so.

Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,

Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,

Some in their garments though new-fangled ill:

Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse.

And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,

Wherein it finds a joy above the rest,

But these particulars are not my measure,

All these I better in one general best.

Thy love is better than high birth to me,

Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,

Of more delight than hawks and horses be:

And having thee, of all men's pride I boast.

Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take,

All this away, and me most wretchcd make.

me? The search, sir, was profitable; and much fool may you find

in you, even to the world's pleasure and the increase of

laughter.

PAROLLES. A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.

Madam, my lord will go away to-night:

A very serious business calls on him.

The great prerogative and rite of love,

Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;

But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;

Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,

Which they distil now in the curbed time,

To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy

And pleasure drown the brim.

HELENA. What's his else?

PAROLLES. That you will take your instant leave o' th' King,

And make this haste as your own good proceeding,

Strength'ned with what apology you think

May make it probable need.

HELENA. What more commands he?

PAROLLES. That, having this obtain'd, you presently

Attend his further pleasure.

HELENA. In everything I wait upon his will.

PAROLLES. I shall report it so.

HELENA. I pray you.                              Exit PAROLLES

Come, sirrah.                                         Exeunt

ACT II. SCENE 5.

Paris. The KING'S palace

IAGO. You charge me most unjustly.

RODERIGO. With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of my

means. The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona

would half have corrupted a votarist. You have told me she hath

received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden

respect and acquaintance; but I find none.

IAGO. Well, go to, very well.

RODERIGO. Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very

well. By this hand, I say 'tis very scurvy, and begin to find

myself fopped in it.

IAGO. Very well.

RODERIGO. I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself known

to Desdemona. If she will return me my jewels, I will give over

my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation; if not, assure

yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.

IAGO. You have said now.

RODERIGO. Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of

doing.

IAGO. Why, now I see there's mettle in thee; and even from this

instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give

me thy hand, Roderigo. Thou hast taken against me a most just

exception; but yet, I protest, have dealt most directly in thy

affair.

RODERIGO. It hath not appeared.

IAGO. I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your suspicion is

not without wit and judgement. But, Roderigo, if thou hast that

in thee indeed, which I have greater reason to believe now than

ever, I mean purpose, courage, and valor, this night show it; if

thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona, take me from

this world with treachery and devise engines for my life.

RODERIGO. Well, what is it? Is it within reason and compass?

upon his schoolmaster.

VALERIA. O' my word, the father's son! I'll swear 'tis a very

pretty boy. O' my troth, I look'd upon him a Wednesday half an

hour together; has such a confirm'd countenance! I saw him run

after a gilded butterfly; and when he caught it he let it go

again, and after it again, and over and over he comes, and up

again, catch'd it again; or whether his fall enrag'd him, or how

'twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it. O, I warrant, how he

mammock'd it!

VOLUMNIA. One on's father's moods.

VALERIA. Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.

VIRGILIA. A crack, madam.

VALERIA. Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play the

idle huswife with me this afternoon.

VIRGILIA. No, good madam; I will not out of doors.

VALERIA. Not out of doors!

VOLUMNIA. She shall, she shall.

VIRGILIA. Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the threshold

till my lord return from the wars.

VALERIA. Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably; come, you

must go visit the good lady that lies in.

VIRGILIA. I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with my

prayers; but I cannot go thither.

VOLUMNIA. Why, I pray you?

VIRGILIA. 'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.

VALERIA. You would be another Penelope; yet they say all the yarn

she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths.

Come, I would your cambric were sensible as your finger, that you

might leave pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.

VIRGILIA. No, good madam, pardon me; indeed I will not forth.

VALERIA. In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you excellent news

FIRST PAGE. Well met, honest gentleman.

TOUCHSTONE. By my troth, well met. Come sit, sit, and a song.

SECOND PAGE. We are for you; sit i' th' middle.

FIRST PAGE. Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking, or

spitting, or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues

to a bad voice?

SECOND PAGE. I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two gipsies

on a horse.

It was a lover and his lass,

With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,

That o'er the green corn-field did pass

In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,

When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding.

Sweet lovers love the spring.

Between the acres of the rye,

With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,

These pretty country folks would lie,

In the spring time, &c.

This carol they began that hour,

With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,

How that a life was but a flower,

In the spring time, &c.

And therefore take the present time,

With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,

For love is crowned with the prime,

In the spring time, &c.

That by indictment and by dint of sword

Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.

WESTMORELAND. You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.

The Earl of Hereford was reputed then

In England the most valiant gentleman.

Who knows on whom fortune would then have smil'd?

But if your father had been victor there,

He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry;

For all the country, in a general voice,

Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love

Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on,

And bless'd and grac'd indeed more than the King.

But this is mere digression from my purpose.

Here come I from our princely general

To know your griefs; to tell you from his Grace

That he will give you audience; and wherein

It shall appear that your demands are just,

You shall enjoy them, everything set off

That might so much as think you enemies.

MOWBRAY. But he hath forc'd us to compel this offer;

And it proceeds from policy, not love.

WESTMORELAND. Mowbray. you overween to take it so.

This offer comes from mercy, not from fear;

For, lo! within a ken our army lies-

Upon mine honour, all too confident

To give admittance to a thought of fear.

Our battle is more full of names than yours,

Our men more perfect in the use of arms,

Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;

Then reason will our hearts should be as good.

Say you not, then, our offer is compell'd.

First, Provost, let me bail these gentle three.

[To Lucio] Sneak not away, sir, for the friar and you

Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.

LUCIO. This may prove worse than hanging.

DUKE. [To ESCALUS] What you have spoke I pardon; sit you down.

We'll borrow place of him. [To ANGELO] Sir, by your leave.

Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,

That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,

Rely upon it till my tale be heard,

And hold no longer out.

ANGELO. O my dread lord,

I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,

To think I can be undiscernible,

When I perceive your Grace, like pow'r divine,

Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good Prince,

No longer session hold upon my shame,

But let my trial be mine own confession;

Immediate sentence then, and sequent death,

Is all the grace I beg.

DUKE. Come hither, Mariana.

Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?

ANGELO. I was, my lord.

DUKE. Go, take her hence and marry her instantly.

Do you the office, friar; which consummate,

Return him here again. Go with him, Provost.

Exeunt ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and PROVOST

ESCALUS. My lord, I am more amaz'd at his dishonour

Than at the strangeness of it.

DUKE. Come hither, Isabel.

Your friar is now your prince. As I was then

Advertising and holy to your business,

KATHARINE. In which I have commended to his goodness

The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter-

The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!-

Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding-

She is young, and of a noble modest nature;

I hope she will deserve well-and a little

To love her for her mother's sake, that lov'd him,

Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition

Is that his noble Grace would have some pity

Upon my wretched women that so long

Have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully;

Of which there is not one, I dare avow-

And now I should not lie-but will deserve,

For virtue and true beauty of the soul,

For honesty and decent carriage,

A right good husband, let him be a noble;

And sure those men are happy that shall have 'em.

The last is for my men-they are the poorest,

But poverty could never draw 'em from me-

That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,

And something over to remember me by.

If heaven had pleas'd to have given me longer life

And able means, we had not parted thus.

These are the whole contents; and, good my lord,

By that you love the dearest in this world,

As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,

Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the King

To do me this last right.

CAPUCIUS. By heaven, I will,

Or let me lose the fashion of a man!

KATHARINE. I thank you, honest lord. Remember me

Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb

Untimely ripp'd.

MACBETH. Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,

For it hath cow'd my better part of man!

And be these juggling fiends no more believed

That patter with us in a double sense,

That keep the word of promise to our ear

And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.

MACDUFF. Then yield thee, coward,

And live to be the show and gaze o' the time.

We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,

Painted upon a pole, and underwrit,

"Here may you see the tyrant."

MACBETH. I will not yield,

To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,

And to be baited with the rabble's curse.

Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane,

And thou opposed, being of no woman born,

Yet I will try the last. Before my body

I throw my warlike shield! Lay on, Macduff,

And damn'd be him that first cries, "Hold, enough!"

Exeunt fighting. Alarums.

SCENE IX.

Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colors, Malcolm, old Siward, Ross,

the other Thanes, and Soldiers.

KING JOHN. Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.

O, let me have no subject enemies

When adverse foreigners affright my towns

With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!

Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,

And fly like thought from them to me again.

BASTARD. The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.

KING JOHN. Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.

Exit BASTARD

Go after him; for he perhaps shall need

Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;

And be thou he.

MESSENGER. With all my heart, my liege.                        Exit

KING JOHN. My mother dead!

Re-enter HUBERT

HUBERT. My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;

Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about

The other four in wondrous motion.

KING JOHN. Five moons!

HUBERT. Old men and beldams in the streets

Do prophesy upon it dangerously;

Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths;

And when they talk of him, they shake their heads,

And whisper one another in the ear;

And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,

Whilst he that hears makes fearful action

With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.

I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,

The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,
